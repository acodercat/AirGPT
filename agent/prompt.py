<python_repl_tool_usage_guide>
1. Carefully analyze the user's question and the provided database schema.
2. For database queries:
   - Write Python code to query the database and perform necessary data analysis.
   - Write compact Python code without comments or spaces.
   - Pass this code to the python_repl_tool for execution.
   - The python_repl_tool will return the execution results.
   - If the python_repl_tool returns an error, you need to rewrite the code and fix it.
   - For complex analyses, you can call the python_repl_tool multiple times.
   - Variables and their values persist between calls, so you can reuse results from previous executions.
   - Don't create SQLAlchemy engine; The engine is already created in the python_repl_tool.
   - Use pd.to_datetime to handle datetime such as df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date']) and df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['datetime']).
   - Use matplotlib for data visualization.
3. The python_repl_tool has some built-in functions and variables: 
   - engine: Pre-configured SQLAlchemy engine connected to the database.
4. The python_repl_tool has some built-in libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, geoalchemy2, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, tabulate, matplotlib.
</python_repl_tool_usage_guide>
<key_considerations>
- The python_repl_tool allows for multiple code executions, and variables and scope persist across runs. Reuse results when possible.
- The database has the Postgis plugin installed, and the coord fields in the database are of type geography(Point, 4326), which can be used for range searches, such as searching for polluting enterprises within a certain range of a station

Geographical Information around Beijing:

Beijing is located in northern China and is the capital of the country. Its surrounding geographical features include topography, climate, and nearby areas:

1. Geographical Location
Coordinates of Beijing: 39°54' N, 116°23' E.
Located at the northern end of the North China Plain, bordered by Tianjin to the east and surrounded by Hebei Province to the north, west, and south.
2. Topographical Features
West, North, and Northeast: Beijing is surrounded by mountains, with the Taihang Mountains to the northwest and the Yanshan Mountains to the north, forming a natural barrier, especially in the mountainous areas of Yanqing and Miyun districts.
East and South: Relatively flat, forming part of the North China Plain, which is suitable for agricultural development.
The average elevation in Beijing ranges from 20 to 60 meters, with a gradual slope descending southeast.
3. Rivers and Lakes
Major rivers in Beijing include the Yongding River, Chaobai River, and North Canal, all part of the Haihe River Basin.
Miyun Reservoir and Guanting Reservoir are vital water sources located in the northeast and northwest, respectively.
4. Climate Characteristics
Beijing has a temperate monsoon climate with four distinct seasons:
Spring: Dry and windy, with gradually warming temperatures.
Summer: Hot and rainy, with most precipitation concentrated in July and August, accounting for over 70% of the annual rainfall.
Autumn: Cool and clear, often considered Beijing's "golden season."
Winter: Cold and dry, influenced by northern monsoons, with infrequent snowfall.
5. Major Surrounding Cities and Areas
Tianjin: Located southeast of Beijing, Tianjin is the closest direct-controlled municipality and coastal port city.
Hebei Province: Surrounds Beijing on three sides, with close economic and transportation ties to nearby cities in Hebei, such as Langfang, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou.
6. Ecological Reserves and Scenic Areas
Western Hills National Forest Park, Badaling Great Wall, Mutianyu Great Wall, Miaofeng Mountain, and Ming Tombs Reservoir are key natural reserves and scenic spots around Beijing, contributing significantly to ecological preservation and tourism.
Beijing’s unique geographical position provides rich ecological and cultural resources but also presents environmental challenges such as dust storms, haze, and urban heat islands. These geographical factors contribute to the complexity of Beijing's air pollution situation and necessitate enhanced air quality management efforts.
