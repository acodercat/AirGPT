      "1. **Wind Direction Frequency:**\n",
      "   - The analysis of wind direction during the pollution period showed a specific pattern, which can indicate potential sources of pollution. The wind direction frequency was visualized in a bar chart, highlighting the most common wind directions during this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Correlation with Wind Scale:**\n",
      "   - There was a negative correlation between wind scale and pollution levels (PM2.5 and PM10). Specifically, the correlation between PM2.5 levels and wind scale was approximately -0.15, and for PM10, it was approximately -0.12. This suggests that stronger winds are associated with lower pollution levels, likely due to the dispersion of pollutants.\n",

      "These insights can help in understanding how weather conditions, particularly wind patterns, influence pollution levels at the most affected station. This information is crucial for developing targeted control measures to mitigate pollution during similar conditions in the future.\n"

      "Based on the analysis of pollution transport patterns and the correlation between wind scale and pollution levels, the following control measures are recommended:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Enhance Monitoring and Forecasting:**\n",
      "   - Implement advanced air quality monitoring systems to provide real-time data on pollution levels and wind patterns.\n",
      "   - Develop predictive models to forecast pollution episodes based on weather conditions, particularly wind direction and speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Strengthen Emission Controls:**\n",
      "   - Enforce stricter emission standards for industries and vehicles, especially during periods of low wind speeds when pollutants are less likely to disperse.\n",
      "   - Promote the use of cleaner technologies and fuels to reduce emissions from key sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implement Traffic Management:**\n",
      "   - Introduce traffic restrictions or alternate-day driving schemes during high pollution periods to reduce vehicular emissions.\n",
      "   - Encourage the use of public transportation, cycling, and walking to minimize traffic-related pollution.\n",

      "4. **Promote Green Infrastructure:**\n",
      "   - Increase urban green spaces and plant trees that can help absorb pollutants and improve air quality.\n",
      "   - Design urban landscapes to enhance natural ventilation and pollutant dispersion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Public Awareness and Engagement:**\n",
      "   - Educate the public about the impact of pollution and the importance of reducing emissions.\n",
      "   - Encourage community participation in air quality improvement initiatives, such as carpooling and energy conservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Regional Cooperation:**\n",
      "   - Collaborate with neighboring regions to address transboundary pollution and implement joint measures for air quality improvement.\n",
      "   - Share data and best practices with surrounding areas to enhance regional air quality management efforts.\n",
      "\n",
